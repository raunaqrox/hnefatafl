## Viking board game

## Rules
 - can move horizontally or vertically as many steps
 - get the king(piece at center) to any one of the corner
 - to kill a piece surround it from 2 sides
 - aim of the swords or red team is to capture king

## Interesting ideas
 - may not be optimized but in the current version there is no 11x11 matrix, only thing that is being tracked are pieces nothing about white space

## future changes
 - maybe for some optimizations a global board state with white spaces

## Todo
 - king killed by 4 pieces
 - control panel
    - hints checkbox
    - versions of game like different board
- rules
- suggestions
- AI
- hover hightlight
- suggestions including different color for capturing
